DLibraryType
---------

Set some variables for handle library types as INTERFACE, SHARED or STATIC.

Use this module by invoking :command:`include` with the form:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(LIBRARY_TYPE <INTERFACE | SHARED | STATIC>)
  include(DLibraryType)

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``LIBRARY_TYPE`` is set to ``INTERFACE``:
``${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` and ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` are set to ``OFF``.
``${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_INTERFACE_LIBS`` and ``BUILD_INTERFACE_LIBS`` are set to ``ON``.

If ``LIBRARY_TYPE`` is set to ``SHARED``:
``${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` and ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` are set to ``ON``.
``${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_INTERFACE_LIBS`` and ``BUILD_INTERFACE_LIBS`` are set to ``OFF``.

If ``LIBRARY_TYPE`` is set to ``STATIC``:
``${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` and ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` are set to ``OFF``.
``${PROJECT_NAME}_BUILD_INTERFACE_LIBS`` and ``BUILD_INTERFACE_LIBS`` are set to ``OFF``.

These variables can be used to handle add_library()

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Set current library as interface:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(LIBRARY_TYPE INTERFACE)
  include(DLibraryType)

Set current library as interface:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(LIBRARY_TYPE INTERFACE)
  include(DLibraryType)
